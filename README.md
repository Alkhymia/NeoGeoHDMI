HDMI output for NeoGeo MVS
==========================

Full write up and video coming soon. Honest :)

Summary: The digital video and audio outputs from the Neo Geo MVS are tapped off before going through the DACs. Instead an FPGA reads the data and outputs the signal over HDMI forming a direct digital to digital connection.

This project might be notable in that it's one of the very few (that I know of) that features working audio over HDMI.

*Nb. The code was originally based off the HDMI/DVI sample code from [fpga4fun.com](http://www.fpga4fun.com/HDMI.html).*
